## Overview

Goal: This study explores the effects of data limitations on the performance and interpretability of species distribution models (SDMs) using a "virtual ecologist" approach with an artificial dataset generated by the mechanistic model *Streambugs*. The study examines how reducing dataset size, missing predictors, and noise in the data affect four SDMs: Generalized Linear Model (GLM), Generalized Additive Model (GAM), Random Forest (RF), and Artificial Neural Network (ANN).

## Data

The input data is already pre-processed (pre-processing information available upon request). 
- The macroinvertebrate datasets comes from the MIDAT database, run by info fauna CSCF (Centre Suisse de Cartographie de la Faune) & karch.
- The environmental datasets consists of environmental factors selected and calculated based on expert knowledge and previous studies (see Manuscript and Vermeiren et al. (2020) for more details). They are derived from the Swiss Federal Office for the Environment (water quality monitoring data, hydrological data, hydromorphological data, land use data), the Swiss Federal Office of Topography (topographical data), and the Swiss Federal Statistical Office (population statistics).
