## Overview

This project explores the impact of various data limitation scenarios on the predictive performance, overfitting and interpretability of four Species Distribution Models (SDMs): Generalized Linear Model (GLM), Generalized Additive Model (GAM), Random Forest (RF) and Artificial Neural Network (ANN).


## Data

The input data is already pre-processed (pre-processing information available upon request). 
- The macroinvertebrate datasets comes from the MIDAT database, run by info fauna CSCF (Centre Suisse de Cartographie de la Faune) & karch.
- The environmental datasets consists of environmental factors selected and calculated based on expert knowledge and previous studies (see Manuscript for more details). They are derived from the Swiss Federal Office for the Environment (water quality monitoring data, hydrological data, hydromorphological data, land use data), the Swiss Federal Office of Topography (topographical data), and the Swiss Federal Statistical Office (population statistics).


## Folders and files

Is there a main script? Where do we set the working directory? Which scripts should we run in which order?

## Authors contribution

NS initiated the study and acquired funding. ECR, NS and AS designed the study. ECR implemented the models and carried out the simulations and visualizations of the results with support by GF, especially for implementation of the data limitation scenarios. All authors contributed to the analysis of the results. ECR wrote the first draft of the paper and all authors contributed to revisions.
